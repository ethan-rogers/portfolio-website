    <h4>
        Purpose
    </h4>

    <p> 
        While a booster stage makes a missile easier to launch, it decreases performance. 
        Given some parameters, this program optimizes the ideal stage size for a missile with and without the booster stage.
        The program then shows graph that compares the performance of both optimized missile over their flight.

    <h4>
        Metheadology
    </h4>

    <p> 
        This program calculates the Tsiolkovsky rocket equations to calculate speed and flight path as fuel is used. 
        The optimization and UI is implemented in python using the dearpygui library. After the project was completed our team wrote a 
        technical report that went over both the numerical results and usability of the software.
