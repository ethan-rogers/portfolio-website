    <h4>
        How it works
    </h4>

    <p>
        This project is a prototype for a mouse controlled by angular motion.
        The Arduino micro is able to send signals as if it was a USB mouse. 
        The cursor position is determined by data from the accelerometer. 
        The user moves the cursor in the x-direction by rotating on the plane parallel to the mouse 
        and moves the cursor in the y direction by flicking the mouse upwards.
        Left and right click are controlled by the top and bottom push buttons. 
        While the accelerometer is a bit noisey, this project was a suprisingly effective way to control a mouse.
    </p>

    <h4>
        Future Improvements
    </h4>

    <p>
        The most obvious improvement would be to make an algorithm that can filter the noise from the accelerometer.
        I could also utilze the third axis as a scroll wheel, but until the noise is reduced this would be to unreliable and janky. 
        If you improve this project in anyway, feel free to open a pull request on the github repository.
